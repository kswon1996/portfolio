            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Sangwon Kim, and my lifelong ambition has always revolved around helping people. I have had the privilege of working in the fitness industry, where I had the opportunity to contribute to the well-being and transformation of individuals. Also, I proudly served my country as a police officer for two years, dedicating myself to ensuring the safety and security of my community. Now, as a highly dedicated Information Technology student, I bring my passion for technology.</p>
            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Upon arriving in Canada, I initially aspired to pursue physiotherapy due to its esteemed cultural appreciation and advanced education, but a spinal cord injury left me partially paralyzed. Through unwavering determination and countless consultations with doctors, I learned I had a condition called OPLL. Despite the initial fear, I tirelessly sought ways to improve my condition for 2 years and, miraculously, regained full functionality in my body. It was during this time of recovery that I embarked on a new path as an Information Technology student at York University, fueled by my pride in this recovery journey. Here, I am exploring how to leverage my passion for helping others in the virtual realm of computers. Through various technology, including software development, assistive technology, telemedicine, and accessibility, I aim to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals facing problems. Join me as I navigate this exciting intersection of technology and compassion, working towards a more inclusive and accessible digital world.</p>
